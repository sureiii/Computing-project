A figure stood there, a fading silhouette against a rapidly darkening sky. Night was approaching. Soon, brilliant stars filled the endless black above. Something was off however, it was silent, too silent...
Slowly it turned around, glowing blue eyes piecing the dark, narrowing in on...me. The wind seemed to blow harder, it whistled in my ears. Then, all went dark, not even a glimmer of light from the stars seeping through.
